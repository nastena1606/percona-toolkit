# Percona Toolkit Documentation

Percona Toolkit is a collection of advanced command-line tools
used by [Percona](http://www.percona.com/) support staff
to perform a variety of MySQL, MongoDB, and system tasks
that are too difficult or complex to perform manually.

These tools are ideal alternatives to private or “one-off” scripts,
because they are professionally developed, formally tested,
and fully documented.
They are also fully self-contained,
so installation is quick and easy,
and no libraries are installed.

Percona Toolkit was derived from Maatkit and Aspersa,
two of the best-known toolkits for MySQL server administration.
It is developed and supported by Percona.
